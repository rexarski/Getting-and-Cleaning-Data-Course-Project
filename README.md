#Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

June 16, 2015

- Download and unzip the data from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
- Then you will get the folder **UCI HAR Dataset**.
- Move that folder and **run_analysis.R** to the current working directory.
- Run `source("run_analysis.R")` in RStudio and two required txt files are generated afterwards:
	- merged_data.txt
	- final_data.txt
